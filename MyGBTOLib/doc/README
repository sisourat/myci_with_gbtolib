This documentation was created using:
Doxygen v1.8.13
dot - graphviz version 2.40.1 (20161225.0304)

The path to 'dot' must be included in the environment variable PATH.

In order to generate the documentation simply run the following command:
doxygen Doxyfile

The documentation includes the README file and documentation for the program
SCATCI_INTEGRALS.

Unfortunately, Doxygen struggles terribly with the object-oriented features
of Fortran 2003+ so the documentation for the main objects remains mangled.
